## About

Blockchain University aims to equip students who are passionate about blockchain with the necessary knowledge to begin their careers in the blockchain-space.

The web-app is very early in the build process, but the finished product will hopefully provide courses filled with videos, notes,
and an assortment of learning resources in order for the student, you, to learn as efficiently as possible.
